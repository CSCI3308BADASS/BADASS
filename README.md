BADASS - Bluetooth-Assisted Device Aid and Search Service

We developed this app to create an alternative way for people to
communicate in case of disasters where cell towers and wifi may
not be available. It allows phones to send messages by connecting
with bluetooth technology.

Our repo is structured using the file hierarchy generated by Android
Studio. The server code is in the folder called server.

To run the code you need to configure the server following the
instructions in serverInstructions.txt. After that, run the SQL
scripts to populate the database and then download and run the app.
Our app cannot send messages in an emulator because it requires
bluetooth, so to test it you need to deploy it to an actual Android
device.
